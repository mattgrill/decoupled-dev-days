      <h2>How to get here</h2>
      <p>New York City can be difficult to navigate, but fortunately there are many different means of arriving in the area and getting around the city. If you are coming from elsewhere in the United States, we strongly recommend you avoid driving, as parking can be prohibitively expensive in Midtown Manhattan.</p>
      <h3>Arriving by plane</h3>
      <p>There are three airports serving New York City, each with easy access to the Rockefeller Center area.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>From <strong>John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK)</strong>, take the Jamaica-bound <strong>AirTrain</strong>. At the AirTrain terminus at <em>Sutphin Blvd/Archer Av/JFK</em>, transfer to the Manhattan-bound <strong>E</strong> train on the New York City Subway. You can then transfer to the Manhattan-bound <strong>F</strong> train at <em>Jackson Hts/Roosevelt Av</em>.
