    <p>Decoupled Dev Days is a small developer-focused conference for architects, developers, and businesspeople involved in implementing decoupled Drupal architectures.</p>
    <p>Decoupled Drupal is the use of Drupal as a content service for other non-Drupal applications, whether they are in native desktop or mobile, universal JavaScript, set-top boxes, IoT devices, conversational interfaces, or other technologies.</p>
    <p>The mission of Decoupled Dev Days is threefold: share best practices in sessions, discuss difficult shared problems in discussions, and build open-source projects in sprints.</p>
