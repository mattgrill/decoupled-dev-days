      <h2>How to get here</h2>
      <p>New York City can be difficult to navigate, but fortunately there are many different means of arriving in the area and getting around the city. If you are coming from elsewhere in the United States, we strongly recommend you avoid driving, as parking can be prohibitively expensive in Midtown Manhattan.</p>
      <h3>Arriving by plane</h3>

      <ul>
